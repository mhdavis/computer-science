### Statically Typed vs. Dynamically Typed Languages

Languages that are **dynamically** typed do not have to be provided the data type of primitive data in advanced by the coder. This is because compiler intelligently determines what amount of memory is necessary for a particular data type.

```javascript
/*
JS example:
in this example you can see that a integer
is not specified as the variables data type.
*/

var item = 3;
```

Languages that are **statically** typed are the opposite. They required the coder to provide the type of data being provided to the compiler.

```java
/*
Java example:
in this example we have to specify the data type. Here we tell the compiler that we are dealing with an primitive data type of Integer
*/

int item = 3;
```
